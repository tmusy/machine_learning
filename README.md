# My Machine Learning Notes
This github repository is a collection of information about machine learning. It has some code snippets and private notes.

**The machine learning approach**

Train the computer to solve a task by let it learn from a lots of examples. So instead of trying to find some specific commands and rules that cover the task, we let the machine find a way to do it on its own.

## Machine Learning Concepts
  * [Artifical Neural Networks (ANN)](ANN)
  * [Deep Learnig](DeepLearning)

## Software
  * TensorFlow

## Datasets
  * [Mnist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
